      <p> The <span id="open1">Alchemical</span> arts, technology and the historical art of memory are connected in more ways that one could possibly imagine. Daily, we store and recollect information and imagery inside the architecture of our minds and transform the worth according to our inner hierarchical file system<sup>1</sup>. The structure in which we store memory has been explored by many throughout history, especially by those interested in the occult. Combining the alchemy of the mind and computing terms, I wish to explore the space in which memory is stored through the eyes of the contemporary artist. The exploration dives both in the physical and the digital, for many of the memory system, such as <i>‘The Theatre of the World’</i> by Robert Fludd, are based on an architectural structure surrounding logic and order, very much like the modern algorithm. In this thesis, I will research the deeper connection between the transmutation<sup>2</sup> of value within the Alchemical arts in correlation to memory and the methods of archiving and data storage in the digital realm, questioning if modern tools such as the algorithm and the hard drive could be the contemporary alchemical ingredients that together create the <span id="open2">recipe</span> for the transmutation of data.</p>

      <h2><i>Sun - Gold </i>]</h2>

  <div id="one-content">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>We are often occupying ourselves with the worth of objects in our physical world. It matters not if this is within the barter system that as been around since the beginning of known history, with coins that were initiated by the Ancient Greek or the paper banknotes that we still receive as a humble gift on our most celebrated days. The idea of worth has been recreated and transformed many times throughout history and has since become a rather abstract concept. What does it mean for an object, person, construct or idea to have a value and could this be endlessly be transformed? Transformation is a term to define the change of something, so indeed one could say that everything (of value) could be transformed, whether it be from nothing into something or from nothing into value. Everything can be simultaneously perceived as precious and worthless, physical or mental, absent or present and tangible or intangible. </p>
      <p>However, without knowing the <i>‘something’</i> one can hardly define what we perceive as the <i>‘nothing’</i>. This might indeed sound abstract, but we often seem to underestimate how valuable the absence can be; without nothingness there cannot be somethingness.  If we pose the question as to what in our society is considered worthless, yet precious what would be the universal answer? Now there are many things that may fit this posed question, but money would probably be the most well known and significant answer. Take for instance the ordinary paper banknote, one would soon come to the conclusion that the material itself does not have any noticeable value. Paper is not precious or rare, yet we believe that it’s worth a certain something. What exactly is the difference between the five euro banknote and the ten euro banknote? The value of the paper or the ink used on the paper did not increase, the only aspect that differentiates them is are aesthetically characteristics of the paper in question created with the tool and help of multiple printing techniques. Unconsciously we are engaging in the contemporary art of transmutation. The act of turning lead into gold. Our very own alchemical recipe. The transformation of value can be retraced back to the ancient Hermetic arts, in which the transmuting of value can be considered as the very core of their practice. It has been believed that they sought to create a matter with the name of <i>‘the philosophers stone <sup>3</sup></i>,’ which would lead to the ability of transforming lesser minerals such as lead into the higher and purest mineral of all: gold. However, this might have been merely a metaphor for something quite different. Obtaining the precious metal has never been the primary goal of alchemy, quite the contrary. Their ultimate desire flowed much deeper into the roots of our very own existence, as described in The Kybalion. The book published in 1908 beholds the interpretation of the old hermetic arts and describes the essence of alchemy and its ‘real’ meaning. One of their beliefs is that gold was merely a metaphor for purification, for if one can change and purify a solid matter such as lead, they would be able to purify and transmute the human mind and spirit and learn the secrets of our existence inside the universe. With this knowledge they can recreate the very essence of being; for what could be more valuable than human life? Humans have attempted to understand their place and purpose in the universe, and therefore our worth. If one could transmute human life by duplicating or growing a human artificially, what would happen to our sense of worth regarding the most precious thing in this world? The quest to recreation or duplication humans have been question, even far before the 21stcentury. The homunculus, equivalent to ‘homun’ which means human in latin, is a term to describe a miniature humanoid creature that is artificially created. The concept is nothing new, for it is believed that it first appeared in the alchemical writing of the 15th century physician, alchemist and astrologer of the German Renaissance; Paracelsus. In his book <i>‘De natura rerum’</i>, published in 1537 he explains the recipe for creating a homunculi. He writes: </p><p><i>“Let the semen of a man putrefy by itself in a sealed cucurbite<sup>4</sup> with the highest putrefaction of the venter equinus [horse manure] for forty days, or until it begins at last to live, move, and be agitated, which can easily be seen. After this time, it will be in some degree like a human being, but, nevertheless, transparent and without body. If now, after this, it be every day nourished and fed cautiously and prudently with the arcanum of human blood, and kept for forty weeks in the perpetual and equal heat of a venter equinus, it becomes, thenceforth a true and living infant, having all the members of a child that is born from a woman, but much smaller. This we call a homunculus; and it should be afterwards educated with the greatest care and zeal, until it grows up and begins to display intelligence.”</i>5</p>
      <p>Naturally, this magical recipe describing the creation of human life was inaccurate. Nonetheless, the underlying alchemical concepts of value and the transmutations of ones very soul or essence remain accurate, even in contemporary times. So indeed, like the alchemist, we are transforming worth. However, unlike our predecessors we do not attempt to grow humans inside glass bottles. Our alchemical recipe evolved with time, we do not associated value with somethingness anymore, but rather with nothingness. Our value is stored within the digital world, compressed into mere binary<sup>6</sup> numbers. Where the banknote still existed out of natural components, the virtual world is a simulated environment, conceptual without physical reality, existing solemnly because of our ever so mortal need for transformation and improvement. Contemporary value became intangible, yet ever so present in our lives. Our transactions are done with cards or digital wallets such as pay-pal. Savings are managed digitally and persevered inside the virtual realm for safekeeping rather than inside the good old piggy bank. The virtual security of nothingness. We digitalised the physical, only for the digital nothingness to exist within the physical again by manifesting in the shape of an archive. A facility with the sole purpose to safely store our data with their location carefully considered taking into encounter the geographical layout, energy sources, network accessibility, climate disaster possibilities such as flooding, seismic activities, wind speed and naturally the option for expansion. Although the data centers may vary incredibly in appearance, what they all have in common are the humming servers inside the rows of racks placed inside a suite safely protected by security codes, iris scans, personal identity verification, security guards and camera surveillance while being cooled by a specially designed cooling system to keep the servers at a set temperature to prevent them from overheating. This physical construct containing our data is the very essence of our contemporary storage and thus when questioning value, what could be more valuable than our very own memory <sup>7</sup> storage?</p>

  <div id="two-content">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Traveling back to the times of the ancient Greece, I would like to introduce the story of Simonide, told by Cicero in <i>‘De Oratore’</i>, a dialogue written in 55 BC. He writes about a story in which the poet Simonide that was invited to recite a poem at the house of a very wealthy nobleman with the name of Scopas. After he chanted a lyric poem composed in honour of his host which additionally beheld a passage in praise of Castor and Pollux<sup>8</sup>, Scopas told him he would pay only half of what was promised, the rest he would have to receive from the gods to whom he dedicated half his lyrics. Moments later during the banquet, a message was brought in for Simonides to go outside where he was to meet two young men that wished to see him (presumably the twin gods Castor and Pollux). Simonides rose from his seating and made his way outside, only to find nobody there. During his brief absence from the hall the roof of the banquet had collapsed, crushing all of the guests to death underneath the ruins (figure 1). The relatives of the deceases wished to bury the bodies, however due to the disfigurement of the corpses they remained unable to identify them. It was then that Simonides remembered the seating arrangement of the guests before the tragic incident occurred. Due to the memory of each of their faces in correlation to their seating arrangement he was able to identify the bodies, ensuring a peaceful burial for their relatives. At that moment Simonides discovers both the art of memory and how the memory of places in correlation within an orderly arrangement is essential to our memory. The tale introduces the concept of <i>‘Loci’</i>, which derives from the Latin word Locus; meaning place or location. For the system of Loci to work, one first needs an orderly arrangement of elements that need remembering and a clear vision of the road they wish to wander. Recollection often seems to fail in a system of chaos, therefore whether it be linear or non linear, the arrangement needs to be sensible and logical for the one using this technique. By mentally building a structure of architecture inside the mind, the places in which the information could be stored are simultaneously created. The imaginary architecture is therefore transformed into a system with a very specific and unique user interface using both the simulation of space and the visualisation of information. Visualisation, simulation and imagination are therefore the key ingredients for this system to work. Going back to the tale of Simonides; without the proper visualisation of the guests and their seating arrangements he would not have been able to identify the corpses.</p>
      <p>Visualising the physical body within the imaginary simulation of an architectural structure enables the practitioner of this technique to begin placing the Loci. The exact spot of each Loci will be unique to each individual,  the information can reside on chairs, inside vases, on pedestals or on the stairs. It matters not where the information is placed, what truly matters is how the user will retrace the information; like the breadcrumb<sup>9</sup> trail in the well known tail of Hansel and Gretel. And so, following the trail back, the user is able to observe and gather the well-placed pieces of information, enabling them to for example recall entire books or speeches without so much as a written word serving as a guideline.</p>
      <p>The architectural memory system can take any shape, for it is an imaginary place within our mind fully constructed with our unique perception and imagination. It can be a street, the town you grew up in, the skeleton construction of a house that has yet to be build or even take the form of a theatre. The Italian philosopher Giulio Camillio is well known for his <i>'Theatre of Memory’</i>, which has been created to serve as a memory aid using the minds recollection in a pattern similar to the universe.
      <i>“...He calls this theatre of his by many names, saying now that it is a built or constructed mind and soul and now that it is a windowed one. He pretends that all things that the human mind can conceive and which we cannot see with the corporeal eye, after being collected together by diligent meditation may be expressed by certain corporeal signs in such a way that the beholder may at once perceive with his eyes everything that is otherwise hidden in the depths of the human mind. And it is because of this corporeal looking that he calls it a theatre.”</i> <sup>10</sup>
      <p>The theatre expresses the hidden treasures within the depths of the human mind, which in return is a reflection of the divine mind. Inside the theatre seven columns are placed around the inner arena upholding the structure. These seven pillars might refer to the seven metals in the alchemical arts and the seven heavenly bodies associated with them: gold (sun), silver (Moon) iron (Mars), mercury (Mercury), lead (Saturn), tin (Jupiter) and copper (Venus) as well as the seven pillars of Solomon’s House of Wisdom. In the book of Proverbs Solomon explains that <i>‘Wisdom (whom is personified as a woman) has built her house; she has hewn out it's seven pillars’</i>.<sup>11</sup> They could also symbolise the seven gates to heavens the Egyptians mapped out on their well composed Coffin Texts (figure 2). By referring to these seven pillars, Camillio is creating a foundation of symbolism; a structure upholding and containing both the heavenly and earthly worlds. The mystical number of seven <sup>12</sup>, which is regarded as a number of mystery, spirituality and the force of god by the bible and many other sacred books, is repeated in the seven tiers in which the yet again seven rows that align the pillars rise. The seven levels containing a cryptic fuse between Hermetic and Cabalistic symbolism create an orderly chain towards the supercelestial world. Beginning the journey inside the arena, the first level tier beholds symbols of the seven earlier mentioned planets; Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus. It visually begins inside the still lesser earthy world by naming the known planets, yet referring towards the higher stages for there is a relation between the heavenly planetary gods and the earthly planets. </p>
      <p>The theatre is build and created to be exactly reversed from the original concept of a theatre. Instead of the rows full of spectators glancing eagerly towards the stage, the theatre is build around the observer that, in their newly found role as actor on the stage, became the centre of the theatre (figure 3). The tiers rise around said observer in a heavenly upwards fashion, creating a circular sphere mirroring the shape of the universe (figure 4). The spectator is located in the centre of the structure and is therefore located both inside the universe and within the limits of their own minds. Combining both the minds and the universe, the theatre invites the user to transmute elements within this structure of order into the valued desired information. Albert R. Cirillo writes in his paper on Giulio Camillio that <i>‘The theatre is thus a system of universal knowledge from a very specific perspective (the only one from which universal knowledge is possible), from that point are the created universe had its origin, the mind of god. Camillo stand at the centre of the arena and looks at the tiers using around him. Only in this way could one speak of it as a universal memory system. As a true theatre of the world in which the whole fabric of being is presented.’</i><sup>13</sup> All the knowledge is archived within the different levels, and their retrieval is done by the use of our mental associations: imagery and symbolism. In a way, our physical body is transported into the realm of the mind, our particles visualised in its inner structure, creating from our physical body a mental device of memorisation using the theatre as our tool, or OS<sup>14</sup> if you will. We navigate the system freely like we would do on our contemporary electronic devices of archival and memory. Much like the theatre, our computer contain a structure similar to the tiered system, however, in computing terms it is called <i>‘The hierarchical file system’</i> (figure 5 and 6). Mirroring the tiers of the theatre of memory, we archive our data inside layers within similar non physical realms, the only difference being that the realm is inside the digital, instead of inside our the mind.</p>

      <p>Robert Fludd was a prominent English physician and Hermetic philosopher whom was employed at the court of King James I of England. Fludd wrote many works about the hermetic idea of harmony within the universe; Microcosm and Macrocosm<sup>15</sup>. The essence of this theory is that the universe and nature (macrocosm) was represented in every individual human (microcosm). The earthly is present in the divine and the divine is present in the earthly, very much like the lower tiers of Camillio's theatre of the mind, where the celestial planets simultaneously represent both the divine and the earthly and where the shape of the theatre both is the human mind and the mind of god.</p>
      <p>Combing the knowledge of both the practical arts such as architecture, mechanics, chemistry and biology with the more occult practices such as astronomy, Cabbalism, fortune telling and alchemy, he too created a system of mnemonics. Both Camillio and Fludd's Theatre systems contain strong references towards the Hermetic arts and astronomy paired with divination, both making use of the mythical number seven. However, while Camillio's system merely contained the planets in his tiered system, Robert Fludd's occult memory theatre is entirely based upon the zodiac (figure 6), which serves as the foundation for his round theatre, as there are two types to his system: the real <i>‘round’</i> system, and the <i>‘square’</i> artificial system. The square system makes no use of celestial, astronomical, spiritual, magical or godly images and uses artificial made up images and places as the support of the system. For those less skilled in astronomy or if the user does not have enough memories of real places, the invention of imaginary artificial ones is necessary. The round system (ars rotunda) features the magical zodiac heavens that are located on the ceiling of the theatre, containing the memory places interacting with the zodiac. This naturally results in a system that is more complex in nature. Moreover, the round system is based upon real architectural buildings, these real places are said to be superior to the fictitious artificial memory places, for one would first need to imagine the fictional place, possibly causing confusing in the memory by yet adding another task.<sup>16</sup></p>
      <p>In Fludd’s Ars Rotunda there are five memory Loci represented by five doors which are to be used in his magical memory system. Three of the five entrances are on the lower level, two displayed as arches and one central entrance recognisable because of its heavy doors that are half open, half closed (figure 7). On the second level the remaining two arching doors open up to a terrace where in the centre there is an upper chamber located. Mirroring the five doors serving as memory Loci there are, located on the ground, five geometrical shapes that indicate five imaginary pillars. The different shapes contribute to the uniqueness of each memory Loci. The five pillars are shown to be round, square, hexagonal, another square and another round. A visualisation of how one would engage in this memorisation technique is cleverly depicted by the engraving on the title page of the Art of memory. Here, a man is shown to be engaged in the art of memory (figure 8). The eye of the mind is depicted inside of his brain, symbolising our ability to imagine, visualise, store and recollect images. The practitioner is shown to imagine five places that are located on the right side of the engraving. The five places are indicated by a rectangular diagram split into three columns. Two of the columns, right and left are split in two while the remaining central column remains the largest. The images inside the diagram are in order; In the upper half of the first element The Tower of Babel and in the lower half; Tobias the Angel. In the central image there is an Obelisk. In the third image in the upper half; A ship and in the lower half; the Last Judgement. He follows Fludd's words on the superiority of real places, for the places he imagines are real and not artificial self constructed ones. We can see that the magical stage of Fludd’s Art of Memory mirrors this diagram. The central door is the biggest, like the image of the obelisk. The remaining four are almost identical in appearance mirroring the remaining imagery.<sup>17</sup></p>
      <p>This system of memory created within the mind, solemnly envisioned for memory recollection and storage is represented by the architectural form of a stage or a theatre. Hereby Fludd creates the opportunity for the images to replace words, making them act out their specific parts and lines on the stage fulfilling their role as actors inside the invented play. We manipulate our own imagination with imagery and structure for memorisation with our brain as our alchemical tool, rather than our predecessors whom used physical tools such as flasks and Cucurbits (Figure 9) to act out the art of transmuting value. Looking at it from a hermetic point of view, the art of memory could also be considered the alchemy of ones own mind and thus memory. We are transmuting worth, whether it be lead into gold or our own imagination into structures of architecture containing knowledge. The mind becomes our tool, our utility, transforming our brains into alchemical workshops. We created recipes of retrieving memory from imaginary yet physical structures of knowledge. Our ability to store and recollection of information with this unique use of architecture manifested within the depths of our mind is a transmutation of the occult alchemical arts of memory resulting in a new concept: Alchemy of the mind. However, our knowledge is stored within the inner structure of our microcosmic self and is therefore only accessible for us (the user), or admin if you will. Only we hold the security key to unlock the doors to knowledge. Our brain, although containing parts of the universe as said in the Micro-macro philosophy (figure 10, 11), still remains earthly and human and therefore limited in capabilities. Although we indeed created recipes of endless information, we do not yet have infinite memory storage. Our only remaining limitation of memory storage lies within our own earthly selves.</p>

      <p>The first person to ever introduce a system of memory combing both the linguistic, mathematics and the scientific within a mechanism rather than a mental system would be Ramon Llull; the grandfather of the modern computing. Around the year 1277 he designed a new system for the interpretation of visible and invisible reality based on a structure of logic and the interpretation of language. Yet again, we encounter the present and the absent, like the imaginary theatre that is intangible yet tangible at the same time. Ramon Llull, with the help of geometrical figures such as the <i>‘Prima figura’</i>(figure 12), not to be confused with the ‘Prima Materia’<sup>18</sup>, created a device, not only to answer questions, but to access truth and arguments that would be applicable for each topic. In his first ars he attempted to produce all the possible declarations and statements about god of which our human mind could think of. These statements where represented by a series of letters, or strings<sup>19</sup> if you will. This algorithmic recipe, or letter magic, provided the user with answers regarding god's existence. The inner workings of his mechanism consists of three circular parts that can be turned 360 degrees that contained a listing nine words describing certain attributes, while the other circular part described nine questions. In his fourth figure (figure 13), Ramon Llull introduced an additional table in which all the possible combinations of letters, or strings of the fourth figure are represented. These strings could then be looked up inside his Tabula Generalis (figure 14). Although it was just a start, the idea of the mechanical object that through a series of string could generate an output can be seen as the early conceptual example of the computer. With the help of Ramon Llull, the alchemy of the mind transformed into the alchemy of information, replacing the mental image of a physical foundation or a theatre for a an algorithmic mechanism of archival. One could even call it a codified library of universal knowledge. </p>
      <p>Ironically, The works of Robert Llull's are, 700 years later, fully computerized by Steven Abbott and Yanis Dambergs (figure 15). Amonst them are works such as Ars Magna, The desired Philosophy Tree and Book of Proportions. The digitalisation of the works in 2003 used the very same algorithmic recipe of truth (letter magic) that Llull described. Not only that, on the website states: Permission is hereby granted for downloading, printing and distributing, without modification, all articles for not-for-profit purposes. The website does not only hosts the computerised works, the programs additionally seem to be freeware; which means there is no payment required and no registration necessary. It is accessible for everyone and additionally, instead of merely digitalising and archiving the books, they have created an entire program to use the tools efficiently. How much of an unthinkable act must it have been in the age of Llull himself; to have a digital program that archives and acts out the mechanics of the Ars Magna. It is peculiar how even though the modern digital archive has become irreplaceable within our society and our personal lives; when imagining an archive, the first association that we have might still be the physical system. The core of the archival system, and the ancestor of our memory devices: The library.<sup>20</sup></p>

      <p><i>“The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries... The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase... There are five shelves for each of the hexagon’s walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format” </i><sup>21</sup></p>
      <p>A library, or indeed as Borges described ‘A universe’ containing all knowledge both known and unknown. It is the database of the existing and the non existing. A centre of knowledge, powerful and unimaginable in size. Digitalisation, universal knowledge, buildings containing archival methods and memorisation techniques are concept previously discussed in this text and are now transmuting into one; the Library of Babel. This infinite information structure beholds the translation of every book ever written, a full description of every single animal species that has ever existed, the secrets of the universe and even the uncanny prediction of our own future. The solution of every insignificantly small or worldly problem would be inside this structure of knowledge, printed upon paper and bound inside a book waiting to be unfolded and discovered by whom accidentally or not so accidentally opens its pages. To truly convey the size of this immense structure, a visual calculation would be in order. First, we have to start off with the exact size of each book:
      <i>“Each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in colour. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say...no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet <sup>22</sup>. He also alleged a fact which travellers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books.”</i><sup>23</sup></p> 
      <p>With these words, we can conclude that each book will consist out of 40 lines, times eighty letters which sums up to 3200 letters on one single page and this times the amount of pages. There are 410 pages, meaning we have to calculate 3200 times 410.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="calculation">
        <p>40 • 80 = 3200</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>3200 • 410 = 1,312,000</p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>This number is the number of open spaces the book has which can be filled with the restricted twenty-five orthographical symbols (twenty-two letters of the Latin alphabet, a comma, full stop and a space). The text reads that there is a book for every variation. So there will be a book completely consisting out of the letter h. There will also exist a book containing 1,311,999 times the letter h and one time the letter g. To calculate exactly how vast the size of this library would be we have to look at how many ways there are to fill one open space, which is 25 times. The amount of ways there are to fill two open slots is 25 • 25, which is 25<sup style="background-color:transparent !important; color:black !important; border-bottom:none!important;">2.</sup></p>
         <div class="calculation">
          <br><br>
          <p>25 • 25 = 25<sup>2</sup></p>
          <p>25 • 25 • 25  = 25<sup>3</sup></p>
          <p>25 • 25 • 25 • 25 = 25<sup>4</sup></p>
          <p>25 • 25 • 25 • 25 • 25 = 25<sup>3</sup></p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>And thus, if we continue on in a similar manner until all of the previously calculated open spaces (1,312,000) are filled with every kind of variation, the outcome would be 25<sup style="background-color:transparent !important; color:black !important; border-bottom:none!important;">1,312,000</sup>. books in which not one book is identical. It’s almost impossible to grasp the immense size of this so tranquil and peaceful looking number. To display the unimaginable qualities, I copied down the first 3,200 digits (exactly the size of one page) of the entire number that as a whole consists out of 1.8 million digits;</p>

      <p>This mystical cloud of code represent the divinity of the amount of information shaped into the shape of books that should reside inside the library, if it existed. Now we have taken a look inside the source code of this library, the question remains as to how this amount of knowledge would physically manifest itself inside the structure of the described unlimited infinite hexagons of the library (figure 16). The answer of this question is rather simple; it would not. Although the hexagons may be unlimited and infinite, the mass of our universe is not. This overflowing fountain of information could never possible fit inside a library, for it does not even fit inside our universe. Let me elaborate on this statement; our observable universe is currently 13.2 billion years old according to the estimation of German physicist Max Planck in 2013. It also has grown in a value of about 108 cubic meters. To calculate the exact amount of books that would fit inside our universe, we first need to establish the amount of books that would fit inside one cubical meter. A book is generally 13 by 20 centimeters, and when roughly 400 pages it would be around 2,4 cm thick. 100 / 2,4 = 41, 100/13 = 7 and 100/20 = 6. 6 • 7 • 41 = 1722 books. Knowing the real dimensions, we will go a little crazy by saying we will fit 10000 (104) instead of 1722 books inside a cubic meter, because even when using 10000 we will only be able to fit 1084 books inside the universe. Mind me not, before reaching this amount of books we will possible run out of mass and create a black hole or two on the way. Even if we magically were gifted an infinite supply of matter, this would just be a fraction of the previously named 25<sup style="background-color:transparent !important; color:black !important; border-bottom:none!important;">1,312,000</sup> books. We would need about 10<sup style="background-color:transparent !important; color:black !important; border-bottom:none!important;">1,834,013</sup> universes that are exactly the same size as ours whilst solemnly existing out of books to fit the library. This means that our universe would be not just a little, but way too small to contain the library of babel.</p>
      <p>Although the physical library might not fit inside our universe, it has somehow been embodied as a virtual archive on the internet. The archive, simultaneously present and absent resides inside our universe. What could not possible have fit inside 10<sup style="background-color:transparent !important; color:black !important; border-bottom:none!important;">1,834,013</sup> universes is embodied within the glowing screens of our devices. Instead of imprinting a set of memories within the depth of our minds architecture, we now imprint our data inside machinery in binary code fathered by Llull. Like the real library of babel, the digital library that houses 293,200 pages encountered the same problem as the physical library would; storage space. The creator Jonathan Basile, a PhD student in Emory University’s comparative literature program, stored randomly generated text files on a disk in his first attempt. Every page named after their own unique url, which contained the name of a text file that was locally stored on his computer, meaning that every time a page was requested by the user, the server opened the file, collected the data and sent it back to the client resulting in an overflowing the hard-drive.</p>
      <p>Within this complication, Basile invented a method of success: the alchemical algorithm for memory storage. Taking the art of memory and transforming it using the linguistics of Llull’s alchemical system of logic, he concocted an recipe that could, instead of storing randomly generated text files on a disk, generate every permutation of a page of text by using an index number as the input. He used a pseudorandom number generator. By doing so, the index number used as the input, create an output of a number between 0 and 293,200. This number would then be converted into a page of text that will remain on the same location within the library (the hexagons within the digital library each have names and the wall, shelf and volume of the book have numbers) as is carefully explained in his book <i>‘Tar for Mortar: The Library of Babel and the Dream of Totality’</i> published in 2018. His recipe challenges the essence of the presence of data, for the library is stored nowhere not physically nor digitally, like Llull's system; both visible and yet invisible, the nothingness and somethingness. (figure 17) We are no longer in need of endless universes, whether they are made out of hard-drives or physical books. The archive exists solemnly within an algorithm, instead of within the mind as seen in previous examples. With this, the algorithm can be seen as a tool for the transmutation of data. The tool, especially in artistic contexts seems unique and yet to be fully discovered.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Artistic data visualisation is the art of transforming data into value using our artistic tools to not only display the dry textual output, but visualising the structure of information simultaneously. The 1,700,000 Documents inside the SALT Research collections that Refik Anadol, media artist and director born in Istanbul, digitised into an immense media installation is a good example of the transmutation of a large corpus of data into visuals. (figure 18). The institution SALT digitised their archive resulting in 1.7 million documents and images relating to Turkey created from the late 19 century to the present including maps, drawings, photographs and letters. As part of a commission with SALT Istanbul while having an artist residency at the AMI <sup>24</sup> program, he used an algorithmic recipe to search and sort unexpected correlations among the documents by training a neural network with the images of the 1,700,000 documents. The vast and rich collection of the documents is incredibly. However, Anadol did not only want to explore the collision between architecture digital archival and media; he wanted to make the archive dream. And indeed, his archive does. During its sleep, the discriminator (figure 19) that has absorbed the images, and the generator begins to produce new images that look like the originally absorbed images. However, they are artificial, like the square room of Fludd. This type of data visualisation transgresses the concept of our digital archive as merely a flat screen. It displays the spatiality and architecture of our documents and the interfaces in which they are displayed. His impressive installation uses architecture in combination with machine learning to challenge our idea of memory, library and the archive. Much like the library of babel, which is called 'a universe' by Borges, the Micro-macro philosophy of Fludd and the Theatre of the universe by Camillio, Anadol explores the universe that cannot be seen. The universe inside our machines. Taking the nothingness of the digital realm and visualising the data into an artistic landscape of architecture, his work transgresses our concept of the archive, not only in his three dimensional visuals, but definitely so in his exhibition design.</p>
      <p>Another work closely rated to the universe inside our machines would be The deleted city by Richard Vijgen. His installation explores the depths of the digital world in terms of archaeology, digging deep inside the homes of the netcitisens that once inhabited the a free webhosting provider Geocities (figure 20). The provider of this net universe was modelled after a world with cities and specific neighbourhoods where the visitor could obtain a piece of land to build their home page on. The now abandoned neighbourhoods were bubbling of life back in 1999 when it was one of the most visited websites on the web, providing a within the model of a city a spatial orderly arrangement of knowledge and information available for everyone. On October 26 Yahoo, who freshly obtained the website decided to take the hosting service down. Within 30 days notice the website would be deleted, forcefully evicting the 38 million homes of its inhabitants and all of their belongings and data. Luckily, archivist around the world made an attempt to download as much of the geocities in the following 30 days. After a month of downloading they were able to compile a 650 Gigabite archive that contained a huge amount of the homepages that were the foundation of Geocities. With this file, Richard Veigen's archaeological project began, for the 650 Gigabite acted like an archaeological site where traces of the past have been preserved. Veigen transmuted the historical time capsule full of data and visualised the files to mimic a city map, reuniting the neighbourhoods together once again. The map's inner hierarchy is indicated by the number of files that every neighbourhood and lot contains, resulting in his digital installation where the visitor can zoom in on the neighbourhoods, slowly revealing the inner structure of the blocks and individual home pages. <sup>25</sup></p>
      <p>Archival, libraries and data storage; where there is information storage there is information recollection. In the depth of the digital realm, recollection and memory have a different way of working. To elaborate on this, I will first introduce the beginning of the digital search: A paper titled <i>“A statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval”</i> written by Karen Spärck Jones, originator of the search engine algorithm in 1972. While using the successor of her algorithm (google) every day, we are often not conscious of how the data is being retrieved online, unlike our familiarity with searching for information within a physical space. Digital searching handles an extremely large corpus of documents all at once, unlike our limited closet space and memory. The TF-IDF <sup>26</sup>, introduced in said paper, is an algorithm that weights words (or strings) by dividing terms by the number of documents in the presented corpus (N) that contains the term, instead of simply counting raw frequency or relative frequency (the term divided by the document length). It does this by using addition, multiplication and diversion all combined in two steps. In the first step the algorithm counts the term (term frequency) and its occurrence in the text. The occurrence of the word is then divided by the length of the document (the amount of words) plus one, resulting in the Term Frequency (TF).</p>

      <div class="calculation">
        <br>
        <p>tf_count = 0</p>
        <p> if query == word:</p>
        <p>  tf_count += 1</p>
        <p>tf = tf_count/len(document) </p>
        <br>
        <p>or </p>
        <br>
        <p>idf = ln [ (N+1) / df ] + 1 </p>
        <br>
        </div>
        <p>By doing this, the algorithm is able to compare a small poem with a for instance a book from the babel library. In the second step, the algorithm takes the Term frequency (TF) and the amount of documents in the corpus plus one and divides them again which results in the data set (IDF). By multiplying the value from TF and IDF:</p>
              <div class="calculation">

    <p>The terms that appear multiple times in a lot of documents have a lower value and thus specificity, while the terms that for instance appear only once in two documents will have a very high specify and value. So for instance, if my thesis would be inside the training set together with documents of all sorts, the world ‘alchemy’ would probably have a very high specificity rate, while the world 'the' would be very low. This is because 'the' is used in many of the documents, but alchemy probably only in one or maybe two. So indeed, the TF-IDF algorithm uses a very human approach to measure data. Naturally, it does not see the difference between one string of words and the other, but due to this smartly concocted recipe, it is able to tell how specific a word is to the corpus. While TF-IDF originally was founded for the use of search algorithms, the weighting of terms inside a large corpus can be used in multiple other techniques, such as data visualisation and even as yet another contemporary alchemical tool, much like algorithm used by Jonathan Basile. </p>
    <p>Looking through an artistic lens, the TF-IDF algorithm can be used extremely efficiently for art works dealing with data visualisation. Dutch artist Manetta Berends used the TF-IDF algorithm for her commissioned work ‘Cyber/technofeminist cross reading’ in the computer-grrrrls exhibition. With help of the TF-IDF algorithm, she created the cross reader that was the exhibition piece and simultaneously the medium and tool for her work. The digital cross reader allowed the visitors to cross-read through a selected collection of cyber/technofeminist manifestos, creating mutated discourse between the manifestos, the user and the algorithm. In the exhibition piece she influenced the font size of a document with the return data of the TF-IDF, visualising the algorithmic character of the TF-IDF and the specificity of the given text. Additional to her typographical piece, the cross reader was made into a website, in which the user can browse the manifestos with a searching engine. The engine contained the function to read the manifestos through the (artistic) lens of the algorithm, showing its colours, offering the viewer a peek inside the mind of the algorithm (figure 21)
    <p>Another example of the use of the newly discovered alchemical tool would be the artwork of Jonathan Stray and Julian Burgess. The duo investigated several techniques to visualise the Iraq War logs in their own unique way, without losing the individual voices of the people that wrote the reports. They wanted to visualise not just a small section of it, but all of the 391,832 reports inside data visualisation document. With the use of TF-IDF they created dots, each labelled by the three words with the highest specificity rate inside one specific report (figure 22). Each dot/report is coloured by the type of incident, which was already an existing data set entered bye military personnel in the SIGACT <sup>27</sup>. Dots with similar linguists are pulled closer to one another creating a network of relations while forming a cluster of colour and overlapping terminology. Inside the blue colour for the ‘Criminal event’ cluster the words with the highest specificity rate are blindfolded, handcuffed, shot and corpse, while inside the red cluster that is called ‘explosive hazard’, the words truck and tanker are most specific.<sup>28</sup> The visualisation by Jonathan Stray and Julian Burgess has not only a strong visual connection to the workings of machine learning but also a deeper one, since machine learning is benefiting in its own way from the half a century old algorithm. The algorithm can for instance be used to control the amount of times a term should be frequent in a document before it is included in the dataset, resulting in a smaller dataset and a model with as minimum features as possible with the maximum outcome, and so it seems that the future of data visualisation and transmutation lies within the historical art of memory.</p>

      <p>While examples have been shown of alchemy in both the artistic practice of data storage and the scientific one, the purest form of alchemy might be our own intimate distillation of memories. We each archive memories in our own unique way using multiple analogue and digital methods of storage. Our methods of storage can even open a dialogue as to which system would be the most efficient based on what type of data needs storage. In the previous historical given examples there was a very present limitation regarding method of storage, for often the storage its medium where the brains of the person in question. In our modern age and with our rapid evolving technology, we need to worry about storage space anymore. We can backup, auto save and duplicate our files all we want, which raises the question; are we no longer afraid to forget, or did our fear of forgetting result in our obsession with documentation and storage. Comparing the human memory tot that of the machine, we can establish that the act of forgetting is a very human defect and is not seen in the machine. We forget in order to save a different piece of data that, in our inner hierarchical file system ranked slightly higher. Computer memory does not quite work that way. Computer work in the previously mentioned binary code. It’s either zero or one. Black or white. They either remember something or they do not. Unlike humans who can have the impression of remembering, or being familiar with something, once a machine has learned something, they are unlikely to forget again. Humans often have the obsession of trying to compulsively keep memories from withering like a flower. We all forget gradually, while a computer either completely recalls or completely loses its data. There is no graduate forgetting, no withering, no decay. We lose details bit <sup>29</sup>, by bit, eventually being left with confusion of corrupt data unable to be recovered.</p>
      <p>Our need for transformation and improvement brought us where we are today; in the age of technology.  Instead of remembering every detail precisely or specifically paying attention to detail we can simply document it by pressing a button on our brightly glowing devices. When presented with an error due to storage limitations, we simply transfer them to our hard drives or USB devices. We can relive the memories over and over again and feel as if we are in back in that specific moment. Our devices won’t forget a single piece of data, nor will it remember incorrectly, like our brain so often does. Compared to the computer, our memories have become obsolete. There is no need for us to use our mind for data collection and storage; we no longer are vessels of information.</p>
      <p>Earlier I mentioned that the Alchemy of the mind transformed into the Alchemy of data, in which the algorithm can be seen as the contemporary alchemical tool. Looking back at our medium in which we perform these alchemical data transmutations, one could suggest that we have a second tool to our disposal; the physical memory of the computer<sup>30</sup>. Wether it be for artistic purposes, or the simple act of sorting and archiving images of a vacation; we are transforming memory and therefore information, with each our individual recipe. We are all engaging in the art of memory. </p>
